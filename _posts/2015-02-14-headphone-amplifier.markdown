## Introduction

At the time, I used to have very high impedance headphones (if I remember -
around 40Î©), so the audio output volume I was receiving from my computer was
very low. I therefore wanted to make a small amplifier for those headphones. At
first, I wanted to make a very simple LM386A-based amplifier, but I stumbled
upon [this](https://www.instructables.com/id/Class-A-Hybrid-Headphone-Amp/)
small tube amplifier. I liked the idea of having a small tube amplifier, so I
decided to make it.

## Schematic

Mr. Beau's amplifier design is given in the following picture:

Note that the design is a hybrid one, revolving around a single tube. The ECC82
is a dual triode tube, which made this design very simple.

## PCB Design

The inverted PCB design Mr. Beau provided is given:
