## Introduction

One of my first major electronics projects was definitely the Big Muff clone
pedal that my father and I worked on. At the time, I already had an electric
guitar, but was looking for a more filled and warmer sounding voice. Given that
we couldn't really afford a guitar pedal, my father decided to build me one.
However, as he was very busy at the time, he couldn't really finish it, to which
I asked if I could finish it, to which he obliged!

This would be one of the first projects with which I would start enjoying
electronics.

## Design

If my memory serves me correctly, my father used

## Construction

My father showed me through the construction of the pedal.

### Etching

Here I learned of my first etching method, and the one I use even today - the 
hydrochloric acid and hydrogen-peroxide etching method. 

### Soldering

Using an old soldering iron we had lying around, I soldered the elements of the
pedal. At first, I was pretty bad at it, but after a few components my hand
became steadier, I had a nicer flow, and generally did well.

### The box

The box was made by a machinist that my father new. Since it was out of
aluminum, it was important to bend it properly and without scratching it. The
machinist did it well.

My father also wanted to make the pedal look very professional, so we brought it
off to a company which does UV coating, so they printed the markings on the
stompbox. The job is somewhat poor, as the markings are misaligned and they
started to scratch off after a few days. This can be most likely attributed to a
poor cleaning procedure.

## Conclusion

Although I didn't learn much electronics in this project, I learned some very
valuable skills which would later enable me to work on other projects in which I
did learn a lot of actual electronics.
