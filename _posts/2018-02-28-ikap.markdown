description: "A Simple Communal Kitchen Management Software."

---

UWC Changshu China, the school I attend, has a single kitchen available to the
students. This kitchen is shared between all of the students. The system for
managing the usage of the kitchen (using paper forms) proved to be ineffective
and overly complicated. I wished to improve on this design by implementing an
online booking system. Currently, this software is hosted on
[ikcsc.site](http://ikcsc.site).

### System

The system is comprised of two elements<sup>1</sup>: a
[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database and a Java<sup>2</sup>
application which handles database management and provides the frontend.

### License

This software is licensed with the
[AGPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html) license.

### Download

You can download this project from
[GitHub](https://github.com/markovejnovic/Ikap).

### Future improvements

* To be honest, I'm satisfied with the fact that this system works well, so I
  wouldn't really make a proper MVC model, nor a RESTful API.
* I am dissatisfied with they way the application looks, but, I'm not a
  designer, so I'm pushing the styling off for a bit.
* A bit more output would be useful, as few users complain that the application
  does not work, but the application does pass testing. Console output for
  logging would be highly useful in the near future.

## Footnotes
<sup>1</sup> Yeah, this is not really a full MVC application.</br>
<sup>2</sup> You might ask: "Why Java?" To keep the answer short, I'll leave it at Java being a bad decision stacked on top of other bad decisions on one very long night.
