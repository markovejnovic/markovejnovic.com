As part of the _mechanical engineering 执行 <sup>1</sup>_ in _UWC Changshu
China_, we were making very low cost kayaks mostly out of PVC tubing. The
original idea was for three teams to construct three different kayaks which
would compete against each other.

### Design

I had the idea of using PVC tubes as a skeleton and a tarpauline sheet
as cover for the skeleton. The skeleton consisted of 6 long tubes and 9 ribs
which provided structural integrity:

The ribs were designed so that the dimensions used provided integrity and
robustness to the long tubes.

### Construction

During construction, some issues were encountered.

A hacksaw was used for cutting the PVC tube in before bending, instead of a
small bow saw, as the availability of the bow saw was very low. Candles were
used to heat the PVC tube so that it may be bent at the joints. Using zip ties,
I tied the ends of the ribs together and also connected the ribs to the long
tubes.

A quick solution to making the entrance was to buy a very cheap hoola-hoop which
was attached to the boat. The tarpauline was attached to the skeleton using
heavy duty duct tape which did the trick.

I made a few mistakes by not being careful, but these were minimal and easily
fixed by re-drilling. The only major issue was attaching the bottom long tube to
the boat before the upper ones, as this caused the bottommost tube to be flatter
than designed, decreasing the stability of the boat.

### Performance

The kayak performed surprisingly well, surpassing even my
expectations. It was nearly as fast as entry-level professionally crafted
kayaks, while winning the competition against opposing teams by an enormous
margin.

### Footnotes

<sup>1</sup> Chinese for _"zhixing"_ which loosely translates to
"learn by doing". It is _UWC Changshu China_'s equivalent to IB
