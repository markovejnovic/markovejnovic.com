## Introduction

As an aspiring, albeit unsuccessful guitar player, I felt the need to have a wah
pedal<sup>1</sup>. Of course, not having the resources to buy one forced me to
build one. I wanted to achieve a Hendrix-like sound, so I decided to opt for a
[Vox
V847A](https://www.musiciansfriend.com/amplifiers-effects/vox-v847a-wah-wah-pedal)
design.

### Schematic

The schematic is given.

The transistors I used were readily available

### PCB Design
