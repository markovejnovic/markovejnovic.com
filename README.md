## What is this?

This suite is a set of `gnu-make` rules which compile my website.

## The Philosophy

This website's philosophy resembles that of
[suckless](https://suckless.org/philosophy/). In brief, this website is intended
to be:

* Simple
* Fast
* Usable

### The Requirements

The website should be renderable and easily usable on all of the following:

* Firefox
* Chromium
* Webkit
* Terminal-based browsers (lynx)
* Mobile devices

Furthermore, the website must be readable in less than 80 columns in raw HTML.

## The Implementation
