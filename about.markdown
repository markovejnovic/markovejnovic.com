Hello! My name is Marko Vejnovic and, currently, I am a
[Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/){:.text--northwestern }
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Undergraduate Student.

My CV is available [here](/cv.pdf).

## Interests

I am heavily interested in systems, networking, microcontroller and
hardware-level development.

My electrical engineering major is focused around signal processing,
telecommunications and digital circuit design. My computer science major
revolves around systems, security and networking.

I am also somewhat interested in backend development with a strong focus on
scalability and backend performance.

## Design Philosophy

My design philosophy is minimalist, modular and heavily extensible. My main
design goal is to make sure that everything I make is divided into minimal and
simple blocks of functionality which can be used beyond the purpose they were
originally designed for.

In a nutshell, I try to adhere to the
[UNIX Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy).

## On Freedom

I heavily believe in the
[Free Software Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_movement).
Because of that, most of the software I write is open sourced.

I prefer to license software I write with the
[GPLv3 license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) when possible.

## Experience

I have experience working with various technologies. Namely, I am familiar with
most modern full-stack development including
[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/),
[Laravel](https://laravel.com/) and
[django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). I am also well-versed in
[React](https://reactjs.org/),
[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Angular](https://angular.io/).

I know the [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) platform at an advanced level.
Consequently, I am also familiar with microcontroller programming with my
most-exexperienced platform being the
[AVR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVR_microcontrollers) platform. I have
experience with motor control, feedback systems at most.

At an intermediate level, I am versed in [GTK](https://www.gtk.org/) and
[QT](https://www.qt.io/) with my preference being GTK due to its licensing. I
have introductory experience with
[Win32](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/) although I prefer not
to use it.

Finally, I am versed in [Android Development](https://developer.android.com/) in
the [MVVM Paradigm](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide) as well as
[Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose).

As for niches, I have experience with [Autodesk Plugin
Development](https://apps.autodesk.com/RVT/en/Home/Index) in
[C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/).

## Fun!

With all that **important** stuff out of the way&#8230;

I like to:
* Play the Guitar
* Make Furniture
* Listen to Music

It's hard to put pins on favorites, but&hellip;
