# About Me

Hello! My name is Marko Vejnovic and, currently, I am a Northwestern Electrical
Engineering and Computer Science undergraduate.

## Design Philosophy

My design philosophy is minimalist, modular and heavily extensible. My main
design goal is to make sure that everything I make is divided into minimal,
simple, blocks of functionality which can be used beyond the purpose they were
originally designed for.

In a nutshell, I try to adhere to the
[UNIX philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy).

## On Freedom

I heavily believe in the
[Free Software Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_movement).
Because of that, most of the software I write is open sourced.

I prefer to license software I write with the
[GPLv3 license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) when possible.

## Fun!

With all that **important** stuff out of the way&2026;

I like to:
* Play the Guitar
* Make Furniture
* Listen to Music

It's hard to put pins on favorites, but let's try!
